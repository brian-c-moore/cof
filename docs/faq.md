# FAQ

### Q: **Who is COF for?**
**A:** COF is designed for teams and organizations looking to operationalize high-level lifecycle principles like ITIL or DevOps while ensuring workflows remain adaptable and compliant.

---

### Q: **Does COF replace existing frameworks?**
**A:** No, COF is an overlay that works alongside existing frameworks, translating abstract principles into tangible workflows.

---

### Q: **Can COF scale to large organizations?**
**A:** Yes, COF is scalable and adaptable to different organizational sizes and structures.

---

### Q: **Isn’t this just another framework on top of ITIL, DevOps, etc.?**  
**A:** COF is best seen as an **overlay** that takes the abstract, high-level guidance from standards or frameworks and helps you operationalize them. It doesn’t compete with or replace frameworks like ITIL or NIST. Instead, COF provides a practical, ticket-driven pipeline that brings those bigger frameworks to life in day-to-day operations.

---

### Q: **What if we already have a process that works well?**  
**A:** If your process is reliable, efficient, and meets your organization’s needs, please continue using it. COF is designed for teams looking to improve or formalize their workflows. If you’ve got everything running smoothly, there’s no need for a major overhaul.

---

### Q: **Do I have to measure everything in detail?**  
**A:** No. COF *recommends* using metrics to help spot bottlenecks and gather insights, but it’s up to you to decide how much or how little you measure. Even something as simple as tracking how long tickets spend in each status can reveal valuable improvement opportunities.

---

### Q: **Is this a pure DevOps approach?**  
**A:** While COF draws inspiration from DevOps and Lean IT principles (especially around continuous feedback and flow), it isn’t strictly a “DevOps” or "Lean IT" solution. Think of it as a pragmatic set of tools and ideas that help you apply DevOps-like thinking to **operations** work items—whether or not your entire organization identifies as “DevOps.”
