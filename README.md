# Continuous Operations Framework (COF)

> Bridging the gap between abstract lifecycle principles and actionable operations workflows.

## Introduction

The **Continuous Operations Framework (COF)** is a lightweight, customizable approach to optimizing day-to-day operations workflows. Inspired by DevOps and Lean IT principles—such as continuous flow, feedback loops, and incremental improvements—COF focuses on operationalizing high-level lifecycle principles like those found in ITIL, DevOps, or ISO standards.

At its core, COF helps teams **map operational tasks into an Operations Delivery Pipeline (ODP)** that aligns with the organization's governing framework. By introducing clear and granular status categories (e.g., _In Progress: Triage_, _Pending: Validation_), it provides deeper visibility into work progress, enabling:

- Precise tracking of tasks from detection through resolution.
- Metrics that identify bottlenecks and inform improvements.
- Faster, more actionable feedback loops.

Unlike purely abstract frameworks, COF focuses on where the rubber meets the road: translating abstract lifecycle stages into tangible workflows. It ensures that operational processes remain compliant with governing standards while delivering value in real-time.

## Core Principles

COF is built on three core principles:

1. **Lifecycle-Centric Approach**: Operational workflows are designed to align with lifecycle stages, ensuring compliance with governing frameworks while maintaining adaptability.
2. **Flow, Feedback, and Continuous Learning**: Workflows are structured for continuous flow and improvement, driven by actionable feedback loops.
3. **Operational Clarity**: Granular status categories provide real-time insights into work progress, fostering transparency and precision.

For a detailed explanation of these principles, see the [Core Principles document](docs/core-principles.md).

## Defining Key Terms

- **The Continuous Operations Framework (COF):** A structured set of guidelines, rooted in core DevOps principles, for enabling the continuous delivery of operations services.
- **Operations Delivery Pipeline (ODP)**: A structured workflow that maps operational work items from detection through resolution, aligned with lifecycle stages.
- **Work Item**: An incident, event, support request, or any unit of work the operations team needs to address, usually delivered in the form of a ticket.
- **Lifecycle-Centric Approach**: Designing workflows from lifecycles that adhere to governing frameworks like ITIL or DevOps while remaining adaptable to organizational needs.
- **Flow, Feedback, and Continuous Learning**: Structuring workflows to prioritize efficiency, incorporate feedback, and drive iterative improvements.

For additional details, see the [Core Principles document](docs/core-principles.md).
